      <p class="question">What is going on here?</p>
      <p>
        This is a bitcoin wallet that supports DLC Contracts.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What is a DLC Contract?</p>
      <p>
        A DLC Contract is an agreement between counterparties on what will happen with pooled funds based on the outcome of an event, as attested to by an oracle.
        DLC Contracts come in two types, enumerated (enum) and numeric.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What is an oracle?</p>
      <p>
        An oracle is a trusted third party that will announce and attest to the outcome of events.
        At the maturation time of an event, the oracle is expected to publish the outcome to the event so DLCs based on the event can resolve.
        An example of an oracle is a cryptocurrency exchange that publishes announcements and attestations to the end-of-day price on bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What is an oracle announcement?</p>
      <p>
        An announcement is a formal declaration of an event that will take place, to be attested to by a given oracle.
        An announcement has an eventId to specify what event it is attesting to, a maturation time, and validation information for the oracle so the outcome can only be confirmed by that oracle.
        An announcement includes the potential outcomes or range of potential outcomes depending on whether it is for an enum or numeric contract.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What is a contract info?</p>
      <p>
        A contract info is an Announcement with additional metadata including collateral and payout amounts.
        A contract info is essentially a prototype Offer that you can review and change to make your own Offers.
      </p>
      <p class="question">How are announcements and contract infos encoded?</p>
      <p>
        Announcements and contract infos can be encoded as a hexidecimal string or as JSON, which is human readable.
        This wallet uses hexidecimal encoding for all input and output.
      </p>
      <p class="question">What types of DLC Contracts exist?</p>
      <p>
        DLC Contracts come in two types, enumerated (enum) and numeric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enumerated contracts have a specified set of outcomes.
        The simplest type of enum contract is a question that can be answered with a "Yes" or "No".
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of events you could base an enum contract on include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Did the temperate get over 90 degrees farenheit in Denver Colorado on day X?"</li>
        <li>"Did Coinbase go down on day Y?"</li>
        <li>"Did team Z win the sportsball championship?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Numeric DLC contracts have a range of potential whole number outcomes.
        Questions with answers in a continuous range like 0-100 can be encoded as numeric contracts.
        Additionally, in a numeric contract a payout curve is specified over the range of outcomes.
        The payout curve allows fine grained control over how funds are distributed across the outcome range.
        The simplest payout curve would go from all funds to no funds linearly over the entire range of potential outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of events you could base a numeric contract include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>"What was the bitcoin price in dollars at time X?"</li>
        <li>"What was the fear and greed index reading at time Y?"</li>
        <li>"How many seats did party X gain/lose in the elections?"</li>
        <li>"How many inches of rain fell on county X in month Z?"</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="question">What is a DLC Offer?</p>
      <p>
        An Offer is the first stage of a DLC Contract.
        It encodes the terms around an oracle announcement/contract info that you would like to offer to a counterparty.
        If your counterparty accepts your offer, you can continue through steps of signature generation and validation to create a DLC contract.
